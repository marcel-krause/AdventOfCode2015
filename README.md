# Advent of Code 2015 - Solutions of Problems

My solutions to the problems of the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) advent calendar.

**Running the solutions** Most of the solutions use standard Python libraries and should run out of the box. For convenience, the input of all puzzles is provided as input files in the repository. Simply run the python script of the puzzle you want to solve. The puzzle solution is given as an output on the console.
